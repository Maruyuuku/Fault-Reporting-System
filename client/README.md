# What is this basically?
It's a fault reporting system that allows for tracking of user complaints and resolution. 
It was made for school project.

# Main Features (as of now)
User: create, view and edit report.
Admin: manage user and manage report (i mean admin also assigns technicians to reports).
technician: view assigned reports and change report status.

It has an email feature (nodemailer) for notification :>

# Testing credentials
Theres a sample database connected. If you want to test it, here's the user details:

admin username: admin@school.edu
admin password: admin123

general user username: user@school.edu
general user password: user123

technician username: tech@school.edu
technician password: tech123

# Semi-important note
If an email of yours is not registered, you wont receive email notifications. 
If you want to receive them as you test the system, use the admin login and 
register a general user with a dummy email of yours (navigate to manage users). 
You'll use that dummy email as your user to test.
